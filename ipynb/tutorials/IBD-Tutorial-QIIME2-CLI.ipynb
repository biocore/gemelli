    "Repeat measure experimental designs (e.g. time series) are valid and powerful method to control inter-individual variation. However, conventional dimensionality reduction methods can not account for the high-correlation of each subject to thierself at a later time point. This inherent correlation structure can cause subject grouping to confound or even outweigh important phenotype groupings. To address this we will use Compositional Tensor Factorization (CTF) which we provide in the software package [gemelli](https://github.com/cameronmartino/gemelli). CTF can account for repeated measures, compositionality, and sparsity in microbiome data.\n",
